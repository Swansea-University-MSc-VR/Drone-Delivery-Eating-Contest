The app features hand tracking to catch the flying burgers as well as mouth tracking to detect if you have eaten a burger.  Hand and mouth tracking is implemented through the Oculus Integration Unity package. The app will run on Meta Quest 2 and Quest Pro headsets, note that mouth tracking is only available on Quest Pro.
